## About Swell Diaries

This application allows a user to upload surfing reports after a session. Swell, tide, buoy, and wind conditions are automatically scraped via APIs across the web so that this data is automatically input when submitting a report. As of this version, only locations in the SoCal area are supported.

### Data is pulled from

- [NOAA](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) (Buoys)
- [StormGlass](https://www.stormglass.io/) (NOAA predictions)
- [DarkSky](https://darksky.net) (Weather)
- [NDBC](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) (Tide)
